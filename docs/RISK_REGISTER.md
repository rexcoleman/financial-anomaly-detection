## {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Risk Register

**Status:** Living document; review at every phase gate.

---

### Purpose

This register catalogues risks that can invalidate runs, fail acceptance criteria, or block delivery. Every entry is anchored to a specific requirement. The register is action-oriented: each risk has a concrete detection test, a mitigation step, and a phase-gate owner.

### How to Use

- **When to review:** At every phase gate and before delivery. Re-scan all High-severity rows before final release.
- **How to update:** Add new risks via `CONTRACT_CHANGE` commit. Mark mitigated risks as `CLOSED` with the commit SHA. Do not delete rows.
- **Owner codes:** `Data` = data pipeline | `Training` = experiment scripts | `Eval` = evaluation/metrics | `Report` = report writing

---

### Top Critical Invalidators

Issues that, if present at delivery, result in **critical invalidation or non-compliance**. These are non-negotiable — a single failure here can invalidate all downstream results.

| # | Invalidator | Consequence | Detection |
|---|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Wrong datasets** | All results invalid | `check_data_ready.py` verifies file hashes |
| 2 | **Preprocessing leakage** (fit on full data) | All metrics inflated | `check_leakage.py` LT-1, LT-3 |
| 3 | **Test used for tuning** | Selection bias; results unreliable | `check_leakage.py` LT-2; grep for test metrics in per-run outputs |
| 4 | **Unequal budgets in comparisons** | Unfair comparison; claims invalid | Assert equal `budget_used` across methods per part |
| 5 | **Missing required metrics** | Incomplete evaluation | Schema validation of `summary.json` |
| 6 | *(Add project-specific invalidators)* | | |

**Rule:** Every critical invalidator MUST have an automated detection test. Manual-only detection is insufficient for critical risks.

**Verification:** For each row in the critical invalidators table, verify the "Detection" column references a script that exits non-zero on failure. Run each detection script and confirm exit 0.

### Risk Taxonomy

Risks are organized into 8 categories. Each category maps to a contract domain:

| Category | Domain | Primary Contract |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **A** | Data & Leakage | DATA_CONTRACT §3-4 |
| **B** | Evaluation Discipline | METRICS_CONTRACT §5, §7 |
| **C** | Compute Fairness | EXPERIMENT_CONTRACT §2 |
| **D** | Method-Specific Pitfalls | EXPERIMENT_CONTRACT §6-N |
| **E** | Optimizer/Ablation Confounds | EXPERIMENT_CONTRACT §4 |
| **F** | Artifact & Repro | ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_SPEC §3-5 |
| **G** | Report Compliance | REPORT_ASSEMBLY_PLAN, AI_DIVISION_OF_LABOR |
| **H** | Prior Work & Reuse | PRIOR_WORK_REUSE §5-10 |

### Automation Hooks

Automated checks to fail fast on the highest-severity risks. These can run as pre-commit hooks, CI checks, or manual gate scripts.

| Hook | Risks Covered | Implementation | Trigger | Exit Code |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Data readiness** | R-A1 | `check_data_ready.py` verifies files + hashes | Phase 0 gate | 0 = pass |
| **Leakage tripwire** | R-A2, R-A3 | `check_leakage.py` runs LT-1, LT-2, LT-3 | Pre-experiment | 0 = pass |
| **Vendor snapshot verify** | R-H1, R-H2, R-H3 | `verify_{{PRIOR_PROJECT}}_snapshot.py` | Phase 0 gate | 0 = pass |
| **Test-access guard** | R-A3, R-B1, R-F3 | Grep for test metric keys in per-run outputs | Post-experiment | 0 = no matches |
| **Budget equality** | R-C1, R-C2, R-C3 | Parse `summary.json` per part; assert equal budgets | Post-part | 0 = pass |
| **Init-weight match** | R-E1 | Forward-pass equality check per seed | Start of comparison | 0 = pass |
| **Config schema** | R-B3, R-C2 | Validate required keys in budget config | Phase 0 gate | 0 = pass |
| **Manifest integrity** | R-F1, R-F4 | `verify_manifests.py` recomputes all hashes | Pre-delivery | 0 = pass |

**Integration options:**
- **Pre-commit hook:** Leakage tripwire, test-access guard
- **Phase gate script:** Data readiness, vendor snapshot, config schema, budget equality
- **CI pipeline:** All hooks (if CI is available)

### Phase-Gate Risk Ownership

Each phase gate has an owner responsible for verifying all risks assigned to that gate.

| Phase Gate | Owner | Risks to Verify | Gate Script |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** (env + data) | Data | R-A1, R-A2, R-A3, R-C2, R-H1, R-H2, R-H3 | `scripts/gate_phase0.sh` *(or manual checklist)* |
| **Phase 1** (experiments) | Training | R-A4, R-A5, R-B2, R-B3, R-B4, R-B5, R-C1, R-D*, R-E*, R-G3 | Post-part budget + init checks |
| **Phase 2** (artifacts) | Eval | R-B1, R-C3, R-F1, R-F2, R-F3, R-F4 | `verify_manifests.py` + test-access guard |
| **Phase 3** (report) | Report | R-G1, R-G2, R-G4, R-G5, R-G6 | Manual review checklist |
| **Final** (delivery) | Report | All High-severity rows re-scanned | Full checklist |

**Rule:** No phase gate passes unless all assigned High-severity risks have `CLOSED` status or documented mitigation.
